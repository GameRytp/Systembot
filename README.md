# Systembot

==============

Hi everyone! It is my first experience of making a telegram bots by using pyTelegramBotAPI.
I hope this project will help somebody to start creating telebots.
PS. Sorry for my english, it's not my native language

==============

The main task for me was to create a bot that will work as a storyteller with some extra functions, such as:
1. Check answers to riddles
2. Send hints to solve riddles
3. Send coordinates of next stations etc.

==============

So, in case of telling the plot the bot have to know the quest stage, the variable that saves in herself if a person have passed the riddle and more variables that connected to message.chat.id. To solve the problem I used vedis database because it's simple and easy to understand how tho work using this lib.

=============

That is all I wanted to say) Hope it will be helpful for you.
